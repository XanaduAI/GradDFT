Grad DFT is a JAX-based library enabling the differentiable design and experimentation of exchange-correlation functionals using machine learning techniques. This library supports a parametrization of exchange-correlation functionals based on energy densities and associated coefficient functions; the latter typically constructed using neural networks:

```math
E_{xc} = \int d\mathbf{r} \mathbf{c}_\theta[\rho](\mathbf{r})\cdot\mathbf{e}[\rho](\mathbf{r}).
```

Grad DFT provides significant functionality, including a fully differentiable and just-in-time compilable self-consistent loop, direct optimization of the orbitals, and implementation of many of the known constraints of the exact functional in the form of loss functionals.

## Functionality

The current version of the library includes the capability to implement:

* The capability to implement any `NeuralFunctional` that follows the expression

```math
E_{xc} = \int d\mathbf{r} \mathbf{c}_\theta[\rho](\mathbf{r})\cdot\mathbf{e}[\rho](\mathbf{r}),
```

that is, under the locality assumption.

* The capability to implement (non-differentiable) range-separated Hartree Fock components.
* Fully differentiable and just-in-time (jit) compilable self-consistent interaction procedures. This allows us to perform the training in a fully self-consistent manner, eg, by comparing the output energy of a self-consistent loop against some high-quality data.
* Fully differentiable and just-in-time compilable [direct optimization of the molecular orbitals](https://openreview.net/forum?id=aBWnqqsuot7).
* Loss functions that minimize the energy or reduced density matrix error.
* Regularization terms that prevent the divergence of the self-consistent iteration, for non-scf trained functionals. This includes the regularization term suggested in the supplementary material of [DM21](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abj6511).
* [15 constraints of the exact functional](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-physchem-062422-013259) in the form of loss functions.
* The [Harris functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_functional), which allows controlling the error of a non-scf converged solution as a function of the electronic error, $|E_{\text{true}} - E_{\text{Harris}}| = O((\rho_{\text{true}} - \rho_{\text{Harris}})^2).$
* A few tested classical functionals such as [B3LYP](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j100096a001) and [DM21](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abj6511).
* A simple `DispersionFunctional` implementing DFT-D tails with a neural parametrization.

Future capability should include [sharding](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Distributed_arrays_and_automatic_parallelization.html) the training between multiple GPUs in parallel.

## Install

A core dependency of Grad DFT is [PySCF](https://pyscf.org). To successfully install this package in the forthcoming installation with `pip`, please ensure that `cmake` is installed and that

```bash
which cmake
```

returns the correct path to the `cmake` binary. For instructions on installing `cmake`, visit https://cmake.org.

Now, in a fresh [conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment), navigate to the root directory of this repository and issue

```bash
pip install -e .
```

to install the base package. If you wish to run the examples in `~/examples`, you can run

```bash
pip install -e ".[examples]"
```

to install the additional dependencies.

## Use example

The workflow of the library is the following:

1. Specify `Molecule`, which has methods to compute the electronic density $\rho$ and derived quantities.
2. Define the function `energy_densities`, that computes $\mathbf{e}\[\rho\](\mathbf{r})$.
3. Implement the function `coefficients`, which may include a neural network, and computes $\mathbf{c}_{\theta}\[\rho\](\mathbf{r})$. If the function `coefficients` requires inputs, specify function `coefficient_inputs` too.
4. Build the `Functional`, which has method `functional.energy(molecule, params)`, computing

```math
E_{KS}[\rho] = \sum_{i=0}^{\text{occ}} \int d\mathbf{r}\; |\nabla \varphi_{i}(\mathbf{r})|^2  + \frac{1}{2}\int d\mathbf{r} d\mathbf{r}'\frac{\rho(\mathbf{r})\rho(\mathbf{r}')}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} +\int d\mathbf{r} U(\mathbf{r}) \rho(\mathbf{r}) + E_{II} + E_{xc}[\rho],
```

with

```math
E_{xc}[\rho] = \int d\mathbf{r} \mathbf{c}_{\theta}[\rho](\mathbf{r})\cdot\mathbf{e}[\rho](\mathbf{r}),
```

and where `params` indicates neural network parameters $\theta$.

5. Train the neural functional using JAX autodifferentiation capabilities, in particular `jax.grad`.

### Creating a molecule

The first step is to create a `Molecule` object.

```python
from grad_dft import (
	energy_predictor,
	simple_energy_loss,
	NeuralFunctional,
	molecule_from_pyscf
)
from pyscf import gto, dft

# Define a PySCF mol object for the H2 molecule
mol = gto.M(atom = [['H', (0, 0, 0)], ['H', (0.74, 0, 0)]], basis = 'def2-tzvp', spin = 0)
# Create a PySCF mean-field object
mf = dft.UKS(mol)
mf.kernel()
# Create a Molecule from the mean-field object
molecule = molecule_from_pyscf(mf)
```

### Creating a neural functional

A more complex, neural functional can be created as

```python
from jax.nn import sigmoid, gelu
from jax.random import PRNGKey
from flax import linen as nn
from optax import adam, apply_updates
from tqdm import tqdm

def energy_densities(molecule):
    rho = molecule.density()
    lda_e = -3/2 * (3/(4*jnp.pi))**(1/3) * (rho**(4/3)).sum(axis = 1, keepdims = True)
    return lda_e

def coefficient_inputs(molecule):
    rho = molecule.density()
    kinetic = molecule.kinetic_density()
    return jnp.concatenate((rho, kinetic))

def coefficients(self, rhoinputs):
    x = nn.Dense(features=1)(rhoinputs) # features = 1 means it outputs a single weight
    x = nn.LayerNorm()(x)
    return gelu(x)

neuralfunctional = NeuralFunctional(coefficients, energy_densities, coefficient_inputs)
```

with the corresponding energy calculation

```python
key = PRNGKey(42)
cinputs = coefficient_inputs(molecule)
params = neuralfunctional.init(key, cinputs)

predicted_energy = neuralfunctional.energy(params, molecule)
```

### Training the neural functional

```python
learning_rate = 1e-5
momentum = 0.9
tx = adam(learning_rate=learning_rate, b1=momentum)
opt_state = tx.init(params)

# and implement the optimization loop
n_epochs = 20
compute_energy = energy_predictor(neuralfunctional)
for iteration in tqdm(range(n_epochs), desc="Training epoch"):
    (cost_value, predicted_energy), grads = simple_energy_loss(
        params, compute_energy, molecule, ground_truth_energy
    )
    print("Iteration", iteration, "Predicted energy:", predicted_energy, "Cost value:", cost_value)
    updates, opt_state = tx.update(grads, opt_state, params)
    params = apply_updates(params, updates)

# Save checkpoint
neuralfunctional.save_checkpoints(params, tx, step=n_epochs)
```

<p align="center"> Using a scaled down version of the neural functional used in the main Grad DFT article, we train it using the total energies and densities derived from the experimental equilibrium geometries of Li<sub>2</sub> and K<sub>2</sub> at the Coupled Cluster Singles & Doubles (CCSD) level of accuracy. The animation shows that during this training, the neural functional also generalized to predict the CCSD density of Na<sub>2</sub>. </p>

GradDFT often follows similar calculations and naming conventions as PySCF, though adapted for our purposes. Only a few non-jittable DIIS procedures were directly taken from it. Where this happens, it has been conveniently referenced in the documentation. The test were also implemented against PySCF results. PySCF Notice file is included for these reasons.
